# SPENDY

### Project description:

Six Matcha lattes and four pairs of shoes later you are at the end of the week and confused where all your money has gone. 
You check your account and you somewhat recognise the transactions, but cannot put a face to a name or rather purchase to a transaction. 
Have no fear the Spendy application is here!
This application allows you to put a face to every transaction. Once you submit your purchase you will see a visual representation of what you have spent.
Seeing the images of the items you have spent accross the week and year, might help you identify where you need to cut back.
However, not every penny spent needs to be analysed. The spendy application also documents the money you spend on memories, so that you can look back and reflect on the good times as well!
